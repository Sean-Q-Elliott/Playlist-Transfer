# Planning Doc

### Initial To Do
- Research APIs: what calls/resources are available
- How will playlists be transfered: mechanism for sending vs requesting playlists between streaming services, and the temporary storage to be used to carry information prior to adding a playlist to a users account
- UI: how will users access this service (website, app,...)? 
- What kinds of inputs can/will be used to identify playlists? (website links, resource links, ...)
